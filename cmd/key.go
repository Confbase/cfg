	Long: `This command helps manage access keys at a per-base level.

Interacting with Confbase servers requires authentication with
access keys. There are two ways to acquire and use access keys.

1. cfg key create

This generates a new access key for this base and inserts it into
./.cfg.json, using the credentials found in ~/.cfg.yaml.

2. cfg key insert

After generating a key through the web interface, the key can be
inserted into ./.cfg.json with this command.`,
